Game engine wrapped around Three.js webgl rendering.

functionality we hope to provide:

Initially looking to easily and quickly push out 2D games.

collision detection
spritesheet animation
input and gesture detection using hammerjs
compositing multiple render layers

occlusion culling

Just a fun side project and will build functionality as time allows.
