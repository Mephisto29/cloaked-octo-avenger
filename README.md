Event driven game engine wrapped around Three.js webgl rendering.

Initially looking to easily and quickly push out 2D games.

Functionality we hope to provide:
<ul>
<li>collision detection</li>
<li>spritesheet animation</li>
<li>input and gesture detection using hammerjs</li>
<li>compositing multiple render layers</li>
<li>occlusion culling</li>
<li>spatial subdivision</li>
<li>render pipeline alterations (shaders and such)</li>
</ul>


Just a fun side project and will build functionality as time allows. 

<h1>Getting started</h1>
